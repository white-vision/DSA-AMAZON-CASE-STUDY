# DSA-AMAZON-CASE-STUDY
This repository contains a case study called Amazon case study, carried out during the cause of my Data Analyst Training with DSA-Incubator.

The Amazon case file contains, Product detail; like name, category, price, discount and ratings
                                                        Customer engagement;  User reviews, Titles and content.
These data extracted where scattered, mumbled together and could not be used directly so as taught by my Data Analyst facilitator I had to carry out a complete data cleaning and transformation.
After cleaning my data I went ahead to calculate needed columns for my pivot table, and I created the required tables for analyzing my data, here are a summary of a brief insight and interpretation of my findings.


## Average Discount by Category
I discovered the average discount percentage for each product category. Categories like Electronics and Fashion tend to have higher discounts, suggesting they may be used to attract more customers or clear inventory. Some categories have consistently low or no discounts, possibly due to stable demand.


## Average Actual Price versus Discounted Price
I calculated both prices by category.There’s a significant price reduction across many categories. This shows that customers are often buying at much lower prices than the original listing — indicating frequent or deep promotions.


## Top Product by Reviews
I  identified the product(s) with the highest number of reviews. High reviews often reflect high sales or strong customer engagement. These products might be top performers and trusted by users.


## Number of Products with ≥ 50% Discount.
 I counted how many products had discounts of 50% or more. A large number of heavily discounted products may signal aggressive pricing strategies, seasonal sales, or overstock. It may also indicate a push to improve visibility or competitiveness.


## How Rating Relates to Discount
I began analyzing whether higher-rated products have more or less discount.The early scatter plots and grouped charts suggest no strong correlation. Discounts may be driven more by category or demand than quality.


## Products with Less Than 1,000 Views
I filtered for low-visibility products. Products with low views could be poorly listed, in niche categories, or lack marketing. These may need strategic adjustments to improve visibility — like better images, titles, or promotion.
 
 
 ## Conclusion.
 The data shows a market that’s price-sensitive and competitive. Discounts are widely used to drive sales, especially in tech and fashion. However, not all discounted products are highly rated or reviewed, suggesting room for better targeting or quality control. Understanding which products succeed (and why) can help shape inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies.
